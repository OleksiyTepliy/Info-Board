# Info Board Project
This is an information panel project.
The panel I used is a 4 element LED matrix, controlled by the MAX7219.
The panel has several information display modes.
1) The clock in format hours: minutes.
2) The clock in format minutes: seconds.
3) Shows temperature.
4) Display the message with a scrolling line.

The panel accepts Bluetooth commands. A whole list of commands can be received by a help command.
