# Info Board Project
This is a BARE METAL project utilized on Atmega328p.
The panel I used consists of fours LED matrices, each of is controlled by the serially interfaced led driver MAX7219.
The panel has several information display modes.
1) The clock in format hours: minutes.
2) The clock in format minutes: seconds.
3) Shows temperature.
4) Display the message with a scrolling line.

The panel accepts Bluetooth commands. A whole list of commands can be received by a help command.
